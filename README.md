# FortuneTeller

This is an Android application that we created for recruiting events for MDC.  It asks the user for the name and email and their interest in
Mobile Dev Club.  They then get either a good or bad fortune, depending on how interested they are in the club.  If the user
would like to save their email, FortuneTeller stores their email address and name on a flat file in the phone.
